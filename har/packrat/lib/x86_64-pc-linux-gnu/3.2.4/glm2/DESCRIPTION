Title: Fitting Generalized Linear Models
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 2014-05-07
Author: Ian Marschner (using code from glm and glm.fit in the stats
    package)
Maintainer: Ian Marschner <ian.marschner@mq.edu.au>
Depends: R (>= 2.12.1), stats
Description: Fits generalized linear models using the same model
    specification as glm in the stats package, but with a modified
    default fitting method that provides greater stability for models
    that may fail to converge using glm
